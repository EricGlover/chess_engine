domain and codomain
-----------------------
f(x) = y
all x's are in domain X
all y's are in codomain Y


injective
-------------
all y's have 0 to 1 x's that map to them

surjective
---------------
mapping domain X to domain Y, all y's in Y have an x in X


f(x) -> y
for every y in domain Y
there exists some x such that
f(x) = y;
the mapping doesn't have to be unique
so x1 = y  && x2 = y may happen



bijection (One to One correspondence)
-------------
a function that is both injective and surjective
for every x there is a unique y
and for every y there is a unique x



Pigeonhole principle
---------------------
 the pigeonhole principle states that if n items are put into m containers,
 with n > m ,
 then at least one container must contain more than one item.

 For example, given that the population of London is greater than the maximum number of hairs that can be present on a human's head, then the pigeonhole principle requires that there must be at least two people in London who have the same number of hairs on their heads.
